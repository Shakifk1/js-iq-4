    <h3>what is Local Scope,Block Scope,functional Scope chain in js </h3>
    <p>Function scope: Variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in the function scope. Local variables are accessible anywhere inside the function.<br>
         Block scope: Variable that is declared inside a specific block & can't be accessed outside of that block.</p>

        <h3>what is null and undefined</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value. For example, let number = null; The code above suggests that the number variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.</p>
        <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .</p>
